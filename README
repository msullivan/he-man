He-Man: Haskell Event Manager, Apropos Networking.

To test He-Man in GHC, load src/Http.hs or src/Echo.hs and type in:

compile "output_filename.c" main_loop

This will compile the program to output_filename.c, which can be passed to a C
compiler and linked against the files in the src/rt directory. (A Makefile is
available in src/rt.)
